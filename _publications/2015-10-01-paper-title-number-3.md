title: 'Class-imbalanced Time Series Adaptation via Multi-Expert Consistency Entropy Minimization'
collection: publications

permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'Wearable-based time series recognition benefits from Domain Adaptation (DA), but imbalanced label distributions hinder its effectiveness. We propose MECEM (Multi-Expert Consistency Entropy Minimization), which uses a multi-expert committee to adjust decision boundaries and a dynamic augmentation mechanism to address domain shift. Experiments show that MECEM outperforms existing methods in activity recognition and Parkinson's tremor grading.'

excerpt: 'Domain generalization (DG) aims to train models that generalize to unseen target domains, often by learning domain-invariant representations. However, overly compressed representations can confuse classes within the same domain. To address this, we propose MsCtrl, a framework incorporating dynamic domain-weighted contrastive loss to enhance class separation within domains while aligning source and target subdomains adversarially. Experiments show that MsCtrl outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets.'

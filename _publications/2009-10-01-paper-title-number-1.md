excerpt: 'Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness, with deep learning showing promise in its grading. However, domain shifts, small lesions, and imbalanced grade distributions complicate generalization and adaptation, often leading to biased predictions. To address this, we propose Asymmetric Bi-Classifier Discrepancy Minimization (ABiD), which leverages classifier discrepancy and distribution compensation to enhance feature extraction and reduce bias, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple DR datasets.'
